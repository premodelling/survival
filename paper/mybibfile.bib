When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about θ, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is ‘distinct’ from θ. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.}",

However, the results of some recent trials indicate that there is no guarantee that the assumption will hold. Here, we describe the use of the restricted mean survival time as a possible alternative tool in the design and analysis of these trials.}",
