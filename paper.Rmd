  **OBJECTIVE** To investigate, amongst a set of probable prognostic factors, which factors may influence coronavirus 19 disease survival probabilities.  **DESIGN** Prospective cohort study; ongoing.  **SETTING** The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, which enrols in-patients at at-least 260 Englsnd, Scotland, and Wales hospitals; the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium (ISARIC 4C) conducts the study. The investigation's patients are patients enrolled in a participating England hospital between 10 February 2020 and 5 July 2020.  PARTICIPANTS  Each study enrollee has a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a high infection likelihood.  The investigation's patients are members of age groups *30 - 39*, *40 - 49*, and higher.  **OUTCOME** Patient survival.  **RESULTS** Inconclusive.  **CONCLUSIONS**  Insufficient spectrum of factors.

# Methods

## Exploratory Data Analysis

* Relationships
* Correlations

## Missing Data

Most of the data's variables have missing values.  Prior to deciding how to address missing values, it is important to understand the missing values patterns [@steyerberg2010]. Rubin [@rubin1976, @steyerberg2010, @little2019] outlines three fundamental missing data mechanisms

* missing completely at random (MCAR) / administrative errors, accidents
* missing at random (MAR) / missing data associated with known patient characteristics [independent variables], or the outcome
* missing not at random (MNAR) / missing data associated with missing values of the factor/predictor in question or with unobserved predictors

If the missing values of a data set in question are *missing completely at random* then complete case analysis will suffice because the complete case excerpt is akin to a random sample from a complete population.  If MCAR does not hold, e.g., data is *missing at random*, then the complete case excerpt is not representative of the underlying population, therefore population inference is not possible via complete case analysis. [@steyerberg2010]

Herein, missing data mechanisms analysis is via logistic regression.  Almost all the independent variables have missing values patterns that violate MCAR; addressed via multiple imputation in-line with the advice and protocols of [@sterne2009] & [@steyerberg2010].
